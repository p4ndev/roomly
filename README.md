# Overview

This open-source application enables you to manage physical space reservations in various environments such as offices, factories, schools, and more.

Users can view available physical spaces, apply filters, make reservations with time conflict validation, and track existing reservations via an interactive dashboard.

The system will be provided as a monolith, packaged in a simple Docker container, allowing for seamless deployment into your infrastructure and hassle-free operation.
